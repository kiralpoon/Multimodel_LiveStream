**OmniLMM** is a family of open-source large multimodal models (LMMs) adept at vision & language modeling. The model processes images and text inputs and delivers high-quality text outputs. We release two featured versions of OmniLMM that are targeted at **strong performance and efficient deployment**:

- **OmniLMM-12B**: Leading performance among comparable-sized models on multiple benchmarks.

- **OmniLMM-3B**: Frontier end device multi-modal conversation with promising performance.

## OmniLMM-12B
**OmniLMM-12B** is the most capable version. The model is built based on EVA02-5B and Zephyr-7B-Œ≤, connected with a perceiver resampler layer, and trained on multimodal data in a curriculum fashion. The model has three notable features:

- üî• **Strong Performance.** 

  OmniLMM-12B achieves **leading performance** among models with comparable sizes, surpassing established LMMs on multiple benchmarks (including MME, MMBench, SEED-Bench, etc). 

- üèÜ **Trustworthy Behavior.** 

  LMMs are known for suffering from hallucination, often generating text that is not factually grounded in images (e.g., faithfully describing non-existing objects in images). OmniLMM-12B is **the first state-of-the-art open-source LMM aligned via multimodal RLHF for trustworthy behavior** (using our recent [RLHF-V](https://rlhf-v.github.io/) technique). It **ranks #1** among open-source models on [MMHal-Bench](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Shengcao1006/MMHal-Bench), and **outperforms GPT-4V** on [Object HalBench](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00849).

- üïπ **Real-time Multimodal Interaction.** 

  We combine the OmniLMM-12B and GPT-3.5 (text-only) into a **real-time multimodal interactive assistant**. The assistant accepts video streams from the camera and speech streams from the microphone and emits speech output. While still primary, we find the model can **replicate some of the fun cases shown in the Gemini Demo video, without any video edition**.

We combine the OmniLMM-12B and GPT-3.5 (text-only) into a **real-time multimodal interactive assistant**. Video frames are described in text using OmniLMM-12B, and ChatGPT 3.5 (text-only) is employed to generate response according to the descriptions and user prompts. The demo video is a raw recording without edition.

## OmniLMM-3B
**OmniLMM-3B** (i.e., MiniCPM-V) is an efficient version with promising performance for deployment. The model is built based on SigLip-400M and [MiniCPM-2.4B](https://github.com/OpenBMB/MiniCPM/), connected by a perceiver resampler. Notable features of OmniLMM-3B include:

- ‚ö°Ô∏è **High Efficiency.** 

  OmniLMM-3B can be **efficiently deployed on most GPU cards and personal computers**, and **even on end devices such as mobile phones**. In terms of visual encoding, we compress the image representations into 64 tokens via a perceiver resampler, which is significantly fewer than other LMMs based on MLP architecture (typically > 512 tokens). This allows OmniLMM-3B to operate with **much less memory cost and higher speed during inference**.

- üî• **Promising Performance.** 

  OmniLMM-3B achieves **state-of-the-art performance** on multiple benchmarks (including MMMU, MME, and MMbech, etc) among models with comparable sizes, surpassing existing LMMs built on Phi-2. It even **achieves comparable or better performance than the 9.6B Qwen-VL-Chat**.

- üôå **Bilingual Support.** 

  OmniLMM-3B is **the first edge-deployable LMM supporting bilingual multimodal interaction in English and Chinese**. This is achieved by generalizing multimodal capabilities across languages, a technique from our ICLR 2024 spotlight [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12038).

### Multi-turn Conversation
Please refer to the following codes to run `OmniLMM`.

<div align="center">
<img src="assets/COCO_test2015_000000262144.jpg" width="660px">
</div>


```python
from chat import OmniLMMChat, img2base64

chat_model = OmniLMMChat('openbmb/OmniLMM-12B') # or 'openbmb/MiniCPM-V'

im_64 = img2base64('./assets/COCO_test2015_000000262144.jpg')

# First round chat 
msgs = [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the people doing?"}]

inputs = {"image": im_64, "question": json.dumps(msgs)}
answer = chat_model.process(inputs)
print(answer)

# Second round chat 
# pass history context of multi-turn conversation
msgs.append({"role": "assistant", "content": answer})
msgs.append({"role": "user", "content": "Describe the image"})

inputs = {"image": im_64, "question": json.dumps(msgs)}
answer = chat_model.process(inputs)
print(answer)
```

We can obtain the following results:
```
"The people in the image are playing baseball. One person is pitching a ball, another one is swinging a bat to hit it, and there's also an umpire present who appears to be watching the game closely."

"The image depicts a baseball game in progress. A pitcher is throwing the ball, while another player is swinging his bat to hit it. An umpire can be seen observing the play closely."
```
